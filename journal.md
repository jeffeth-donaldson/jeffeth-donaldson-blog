I started my project today. I decided to go with strapi as my cms. I like that it can be hosted by myself. To download it, I followed their guide here: [https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/quick-start](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/quick-start). I needed to downgrade my node.js installation to get it to work. To do that I used [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/tree/master). nvm was pretty simple to install and very intuitive to use, just `nvm install --lts` and I was off to the races. Then I was able to install strapi with yarn and start a quickstart project. I created my admin account using the portal (not sure if that is local or if I've now got some account in the cloud somewhere.) I can't do much else because I need to cook dinner. toodles.

addendum: after dinner I was feeling extra productive so I played around with the UI in strapi and created my first model. (blog post). Now I need to see how I go about hosting it.
