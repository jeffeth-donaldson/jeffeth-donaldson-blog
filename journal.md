I started my project today. I decided to go with strapi as my cms. I like that it can be hosted by myself. To download it, I followed their guide here: [https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/quick-start](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/quick-start). I needed to downgrade my node.js installation to get it to work. To do that I used [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/tree/master). nvm was pretty simple to install and very intuitive to use, just `nvm install --lts` and I was off to the races. Then I was able to install strapi with yarn and start a quickstart project. I created my admin account using the portal (not sure if that is local or if I've now got some account in the cloud somewhere.) I can't do much else because I need to cook dinner. toodles.

addendum: after dinner I was feeling extra productive so I played around with the UI in strapi and created my first model. (blog post). Now I need to see how I go about hosting it.

I tested the api generated by strapi today. I have created a collection in Insomnium for that express purpose. To use the API I had to create an API key, I did that and saved it in `api.token` in the jeffeth-donaldson-blog dir. Here's the [api reference](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/api/rest#api-parameters) for later. *NOTE:* make sure you are using the 'plural' api Id (so just add an 's' to the end).

I also added an `about` single content type. This is where I put my about-me stuff. I'll be able to pull it into an about-me page as well as the bottom of any blog posts I write. I've decided to use svelte for my frontend. I'm going to try using sveltekit. THe difference between svelte and sveltekit is that sveltekit comes with a router. I've never used it before, but luckily there is a [guide from strapi](https://strapi.io/blog/how-to-create-a-blog-with-svelte-kit-strapi) that talks about integrating the two. 

I went ahead and started on that guide just enough to create the sveltekit demo app.

Something Else I researched today was hosting. I think I'll use my always-free tier vm on oracle cloud. I want to do this all official-like so I want to have a proper domain name as well as a ssl certificate so I can do https. I found a [guide](https://blogs.oracle.com/developers/post/free-ssl-certificates-in-the-oracle-cloud-using-certbot-and-lets-encrypt) that talks about how I can set up a certificate to auto renew.

What's left for me to do on the overall roadmap is:
1. determine what program I'll use to host my app (Node? Apache?)
2. figure out how I'm going to get a domain name

Unfortunately for me, that strapi tutorial is very old, so the svelte stuff is quite outdated. I'll still be able to use it to interface with strapi (kind of) but for svelte, I'm kind of on my own. So I rebuilt the svelte part from scratch, and started on a very basic skeleton. I think my goal for next time will be to get a skeleton for displaying a blog post working. From there I can spend all the time in the world styling! (not fun)
